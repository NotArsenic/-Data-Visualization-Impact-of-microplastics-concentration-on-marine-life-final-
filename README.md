DVP

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the impact of microplastics concentration on marine life. Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, folium, matplotlib/seaborn, and branca, this project aims to shed light on the pervasive issue of microplastic pollution in our oceans and its consequences for marine ecosystems.

Data Collection and Preprocessing: The repository includes scripts for collecting and preprocessing data on microplastics concentration levels in various marine environments. This involves cleaning, formatting, and organizing the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using pandas and numpy, the repository conducts EDA to uncover insights into the distribution and trends of microplastics concentration across different regions and time periods. This step involves statistical analysis and visualization to identify patterns and correlations.

Spatial Visualization: Leveraging the folium library, the project creates interactive maps to visualize the geographical distribution of microplastics concentration hotspots. These maps provide a dynamic way to explore how microplastic pollution varies across different marine habitats.

Temporal Trends: Through matplotlib/seaborn, the repository visualizes temporal trends in microplastics concentration levels over time. This analysis helps in understanding how the problem of microplastic pollution has evolved and intensified over the years.

Impact on Marine Life: The project explores the direct and indirect impacts of microplastics on marine organisms. This includes visualizations depicting correlations between microplastics concentration and factors such as marine biodiversity, species decline, and ecosystem health.

Educational Outreach: In addition to the technical analysis, the repository includes resources and visualizations suitable for educational outreach. These materials aim to raise awareness about the environmental implications of microplastic pollution and inspire action towards mitigating its effects.
